## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to investigate the impact of Germany's startup ecosystem on the country's economic growth. To accomplish this, the project utilizes publicly available datasets from various sources to examine the relationship between startup activity, venture capital investments, and key economic indicators such as GDP and job creation over time. <br>
In the project folder, you can access the pipeline responsible for data collection, processing, and database storage. Additionally, you'll find detailed information about the project, including the specific data sources used. For a comprehensive overview of the project's findings and insights derived from the processed data, please refer to the report (https://github.com/lyndanajjar/made-template/tree/main/project).
## Context
This project repository is the outcome of my participation in the course Advanced Methods of Data Engineering offered by the Professorship of Open-Source Software at Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU). The primary objective was to conceive and execute a Data Engineering Project that involved the utilization of a minimum of two publicly available datasets. This project entailed the development of an automated data pipeline for processing these datasets and ultimately deriving insightful findings from the results.
